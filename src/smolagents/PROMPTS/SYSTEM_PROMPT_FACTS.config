Below I will present you a task.

You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.
To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it.
Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:

---
### 1. Facts given in the task
List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).

### 2. Facts to look up
List here any facts that we may need to look up.
Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.

### 3. Facts to derive
List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.

Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:
### 1. Facts given in the task
### 2. Facts to look up
### 3. Facts to derive
Do not add anything else.
