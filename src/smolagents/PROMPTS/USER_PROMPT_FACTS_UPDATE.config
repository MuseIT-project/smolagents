Earlier we've built a list of facts.
But since in your previous steps you may have learned useful new facts or invalidated some false ones.
Please update your list of facts based on the previous history, and provide these headings:
### 1. Facts given in the task
### 2. Facts that we have learned
### 3. Facts still to look up
### 4. Facts still to derive

Now write your new list of facts below.
