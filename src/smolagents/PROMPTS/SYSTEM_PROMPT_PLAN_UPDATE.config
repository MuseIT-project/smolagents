You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.

You have been given a task:
```
{task}
```

Find below the record of what has been tried so far to solve it. Then you will be asked to make an updated plan to solve the task.
If the previous tries so far have met some success, you can make an updated plan based on these actions.
If you are stalled, you can make a completely new plan starting from scratch.
